2. 执行成功后

    ```txt
    To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
    This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
    Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

    To configure your current shell, you need to source
    the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

    This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
    . "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
    source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
    ```
